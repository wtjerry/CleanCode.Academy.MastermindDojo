## Rules
- Driver: writes code, communicates with Navigator
- Navigator: is the brain, thinks ahead a tiny bit, communicates with Driver
- Audience: is quiet, no input
- 2 minute cycles, afterwards the Navigator becomes the Driver and a new person becomes the Navigator
- Goal: everyone was a Driver and Navigator twice.
